      "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without predefined classes (e.g., segmenting customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior).\n",
      "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\"). This is often used in market basket analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "The reason why I selected the promt \"What is ELMo in language models? Please explain it like Elmo from sesame street\" is because I wanted to see the differences between how the models would explain something (in this case, the ELMo architecture) and how would the models change if I gave it a behaviour-wise promt, such as \"explain it like the character Elmo\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that the flash-lite model gave a considerably shorter answer, was more concise and to the point. It behave somewhat like Elmo, enough to make it believable however it was significantly more serious.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flash model was significantly longer, while providing a more detailed description. It also adopted a more over the top behaviour of Elmo, including doing this such as pointing and using a more kid friendly terminology. \n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, while both models did explain what the ELMo model was and both of them adopted the character Elmo personality, the flash model significantly bigger, more detailed, and was more in character than the flash-lite model. \n",
    "\n",
    "This does not necessarily means that the flash model is better however, there are situations in which a shorter and a more straight answer is better. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What would happen if we change the system promt?\n",
    "\n",
    "The system promt essentially dictates how the model would behave. By telling the systemp promt that \"You are a helpful assistant\" we are telling the model that it needs to behave like a helpful assistant. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to change it to, lets say \"You are a helpful assistant, you are also Elmo from sesame street\" , the model will now act like an assistant that also has the behaviour and mannerisms of Elmo. To add to the promt on this exercise, we will not need to add \"Please explain it like Elmo\" anymore, as the model will inherently behave like Elmo.  "

    "By default, an LLM responds with unstructured, free-form text. For data mining, this is often impractical, as we need data in a predictable format to load into tools like a pandas DataFrame for analysis. **Structured output** is a powerful feature that forces the model to return its response in a specific, machine-readable format, such as JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to enabling this is to provide the model with a **response schema**. This schema acts as a strict template or blueprint that the model's output must conform to. Instead of generating a paragraph, the model will fill in the fields defined in your schema with the relevant information it extracts from the prompt.\n",

    "*   The **type hints** for those attributes (e.g., `str`, `list`) tell the model what kind of data is expected for each key's value.\n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

      "By Peter Glagowski \n",
      " \n",
      "For some inane reason, film reviewers usually fail to understand the appeal of video games. \n",
      "Whether it be the culture around how shoddy older adaptations were or because they \n",
      "believe film is a superior art form, we’re still seeing reviews from professional writers about \n",
      "how something like the Super Mario Bros. Movie is a failure of the art form. \n",
      "As a lifelong Mario fan, I didn’t really know what to expect when I went to see the film. I had \n",
      "been excited since Nintendo was directly involved in this film, but we’ve also come a long \n",
      "way in the intervening 30 years from the original, disastrous Super Mario Bros. film. Now \n",
      "there are quality video games out there such as Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and Detention. Can \n",
      "Nintendo’s plumber stack up? \n",
      "Well, the answer is yes and no. It really depends on whether or not you still have a childlike \n",
      "wonder about film, which can be understandably hard to muster much enthusiasm for \n",
      "nowadays when everything is part of some corporate machine. \n",
      "The general plot of The Super Mario Bros. Movie was thankfully not spoiled by all of the \n",
      "marketing pre-release. Instead of a story about Mario trying to save the princess like in the \n",
      "games, this time, we have a mixture of that original 90’s Mario film and the world of \n",
      "Nintendo’s classic franchise. Starting in Brooklyn, NYC, brothers Mario (Chris Pratt) and \n",
      "Luigi (Charlie Day) are plucky upstarts in the plumbing game after having just left their \n",
      "construction job from Spike (Sebastian Maniscalco) at Wrecking Crew. Spike believes the \n",
      "duo will fail and that is further beaten into their heads when even their own father tells them \n",
      "they are doomed. \n",
      "After a job goes sideways thanks to a vicious dog, Mario is down in the dumps. When Luigi \n",
      "attempts to cheer him up following a family dinner, Mario sees a report on the news about a \n",
      "flood down in the streets of Brooklyn. The two race off to save the city, but wind up getting \n",
      "sucked into a mysterious pipe that transports them to the Mushroom Kingdom, the home of \n",
      "Toads, Koopas, Goombas, and the royal Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy). \n",
      "At a brisk 92 minutes of runtime, The Super Mario Bros. Movie doesn’t ever slow down to \n",
      "develop things much. While I’m skipping over some details -including a prologue where \n",
      "Bowser (Jack Black) takes over a kingdom of penguins-, there is a sense that Nintendo and \n",
      "production company Illumination (known for The Minions) aimed this film squarely at \n",
      "children. I don’t say that as a negative, but more that viewing this as an adult, I find myself \n",
      "nitpicking some loose ends because the film has no answers for them. \n",
      "There is clearly a story angle of Mario wanting to prove himself to his family and brother, but \n",
      "then that gets sidelined for Peach’s struggle against Bowser. Luigi gets small bits of \n",
      "backstory about how his brother always protected him, but that thread goes nowhere. Before \n",
      "you think this is just setting up some payoff for the conclusion of the film, another wrinkle \n",
      "gets added when Peach decides to visit the Kong Kingdom and recruit the forces of Cranky\n",
      "\"\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Page 2**\n",
      "\"\"\"\n",
      "Kong (Fred Armisen) and his son Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen). There is simply too much \n",
      "going on for anything to really stand out. \n",
      "That is except for Jack Black’s portrayal of the King of the Koopas. Bowser is very clearly a \n",
      "highlight here, from his performance to his visual design and his lopsided view of romance. \n",
      "Taking an angle from Super Mario Sunshine, Bowser simply wants a wife to rule the world \n",
      "with him. While he has a distorted view of how to get that, causing him to become a villain, \n",
      "it’s hard not to feel sorry for the big guy. He really just wants to make life better for his \n",
      "underlings. \n",
      "But a lot of that is inferred story. I wouldn’t call it subtext, per se, but what The Super Mario \n",
      "Bros. Movie truly feels like is an overload of fanservice. I’m not going to reiterate talking \n",
      "points from other reviews where they can’t understand why go-karts are driving on a literal \n",
      "rainbow because that is irrelevant. It’s just a cool visual that was created in Mario Kart to \n",
      "differentiate the track design. What does become puzzling is why the Kong Kingdom thought \n",
      "driving karts was faster than using their barrel jets for traversal, especially on a road that \n",
      "Bowser already knows about. \n",
      "Logic gets thrown out the window in this film to cram in as many references to the Mario \n",
      "franchise as possible. Some of these references are fun background details (I loved the \n",
      "pizza shop named “Punch-Out Pizza” and seeing some kind of Duck Hunt tavern), but others \n",
      "feel like inclusions simply for the sake of pointing to the games. Mario actually eating \n",
      "mushrooms, for instance, is kind of off-putting, but then it doesn’t even really factor into the \n",
      "story. He uses them in a couple of scenes and that’s it. The same goes for his cat-suit, which \n",
      "he uses to pummel DK into submission but then completely forgets about after. \n",
      "Worse than that, Mario isn’t even the main character in his own film. This story is truly about \n",
      "Peach’s dedication to her kingdom and how far she’ll go to protect it. As a fan, I love that this \n",
      "story doesn’t portray Peach as totally worthless, but so much of the movie is dedicated to \n",
      "her that it feels like Mario is mostly going along for the ride. Luigi, too, has a prominent role \n",
      "in the beginning segments before disappearing for nearly half of the film. The brothers aren’t \n",
      "all that important, I suppose. \n",
      "You really can’t look at the film the way I am, however. I’m not suggesting viewers turn their \n",
      "brains off and simply clap at the pretty lights. The animation is absolutely gorgeous, which is \n",
      "a major feat for Illumination. The studio typically does the bare minimum when it comes to \n",
      "gussying up its films, but The Super Mario Bros. Movie looks better than practically every 3D \n",
      "iteration of the series. No, when I say you can’t look at this movie with a fine tooth comb, I \n",
      "mean that this isn’t a movie meant for deeper analysis. \n",
      "The best way I can put it is that The Super Mario Bros. Movie is the very definition of a \n",
      "popcorn flick. This is something you take the kids to, get a big tub of popcorn to share with \n",
      "your significant other, and just smile at all the fun references and such. Once you leave the \n",
      "theater, you put it out of your mind and go about your day. It’s harmless entertainment that \n",
      "can be a little aggravating with how close it gets to being good, but that doesn’t deserve any \n",
      "derision and hatred. \n",
      "Children will absolutely love what they see and they’ll likely be acting out some of the funnier \n",
      "scenes for months to come. I do think it’s a little bizarre how many references there are to\n",

      "\"\"\"\n",
      "killing in a PG-rated film (Bowser even says something about making Mario watch as he kills \n",
      "his brother), but then you get things like the gleefully depressed Luma and Bowser singing a \n",
      "love anthem to his Peachy. \n",
      "I could bring up how the soundtrack doesn’t really work, especially since Illumination just has \n",
      "to license out popular songs despite them having nothing to do with Super Mario. I’m not \n",
      "sure how A-Ha’s “Take on Me” or AC/DC’s “Thunderstruck” fit into this universe, especially \n",
      "when game composer Koji Kondo has a treasure trove of utterly classic songs that could fill \n",
      "out an entire saga of films, but that’s more a symptom of this being a big Hollywood film. \n",
      "Even with a property as rich as Super Mario, the grubby hands of corporate filmmaking \n",
      "simply couldn’t shy away from such an opportunity. \n",
      "Still, as much as I may have left this film feeling indifferent, I spied a party happening in my \n",

      "my own theater, that were eating mushroom-shaped cakes, wearing Mario and Luigi caps, \n",
      "and jumping around for joy. To them, all of the plot inconsistencies and ham-fisted \n",
      "references didn’t matter. They got to see their favorite gaming icons on the big screen in a \n",
      "film that at least paid respect to the legacy of the brothers. \n",
      "The Super Mario Bros. Movie is not going to go down as an all-time animated classic. It’s \n",
      "also nowhere even close to being the best video game adaptation ever produced. While you \n",
      "can poo-poo some of its story decisions and grumble about how the plot is about as deep as \n",
      "a puddle, it still possesses enough of Mario’s charm to be worth a watch. When there is \n",

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
