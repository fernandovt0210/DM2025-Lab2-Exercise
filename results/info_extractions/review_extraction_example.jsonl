Movie \nBy Peter Glagowski \n \nFor some inane reason, film reviewers usually fail to understand the appeal of video games. \nWhether it be the culture around how shoddy older adaptations were or because they \nbelieve film is a superior art form, we’re still seeing reviews from professional writers about \nhow something like the Super Mario Bros. Movie is a failure of the art form. \nAs a lifelong Mario fan, I didn’t really know what to expect when I went to see the film. I had \nbeen excited since Nintendo was directly involved in this film, but we’ve also come a long \nway in the intervening 30 years from the original, disastrous Super Mario Bros. film. Now \nthere are quality video games out there such as Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and Detention. Can \nNintendo’s plumber stack up? \nWell, the answer is yes and no. It really depends on whether or not you still have a childlike \nwonder about film, which can be understandably hard to muster much enthusiasm for \nnowadays when everything is part of some corporate machine. \nThe general plot of The Super Mario Bros. Movie was thankfully not spoiled by all of the \nmarketing pre-release. Instead of a story about Mario trying to save the princess like in the \ngames, this time, we have a mixture of that original 90’s Mario film and the world of \nNintendo’s classic franchise. Starting in Brooklyn, NYC, brothers Mario (Chris Pratt) and \nLuigi (Charlie Day) are plucky upstarts in the plumbing game after having just left their \nconstruction job from Spike (Sebastian Maniscalco) at Wrecking Crew. Spike believes the \nduo will fail and that is further beaten into their heads when even their own father tells them \nthey are doomed. \nAfter a job goes sideways thanks to a vicious dog, Mario is down in the dumps. When Luigi \nattempts to cheer him up following a family dinner, Mario sees a report on the news about a \nflood down in the streets of Brooklyn. The two race off to save the city, but wind up getting \nsucked into a mysterious pipe that transports them to the Mushroom Kingdom, the home of \nToads, Koopas, Goombas, and the royal Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy). \nAt a brisk 92 minutes of runtime, The Super Mario Bros. Movie doesn’t ever slow down to \ndevelop things much. While I’m skipping over some details -including a prologue where \nBowser (Jack Black) takes over a kingdom of penguins-, there is a sense that Nintendo and \nproduction company Illumination (known for The Minions) aimed this film squarely at \nchildren. I don’t say that as a negative, but more that viewing this as an adult, I find myself \nnitpicking some loose ends because the film has no answers for them. \nThere is clearly a story angle of Mario wanting to prove himself to his family and brother, but \nthen that gets sidelined for Peach’s struggle against Bowser. Luigi gets small bits of \nbackstory about how his brother always protected him, but that thread goes nowhere. Before \nyou think this is just setting up some payoff for the conclusion of the film, another wrinkle \ngets added when Peach decides to visit the Kong Kingdom and recruit the forces of Cranky\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 2**\n\"\"\"\nKong (Fred Armisen) and his son Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen). There is simply too much \ngoing on for anything to really stand out. \nThat is except for Jack Black’s portrayal of the King of the Koopas. Bowser is very clearly a \nhighlight here, from his performance to his visual design and his lopsided view of romance. \nTaking an angle from Super Mario Sunshine, Bowser simply wants a wife to rule the world \nwith him. While he has a distorted view of how to get that, causing him to become a villain, \nit’s hard not to feel sorry for the big guy. He really just wants to make life better for his \nunderlings. \nBut a lot of that is inferred story. I wouldn’t call it subtext, per se, but what The Super Mario \nBros. Movie truly feels like is an overload of fanservice. I’m not going to reiterate talking \npoints from other reviews where they can’t understand why go-karts are driving on a literal \nrainbow because that is irrelevant. It’s just a cool visual that was created in Mario Kart to \ndifferentiate the track design. What does become puzzling is why the Kong Kingdom thought \ndriving karts was faster than using their barrel jets for traversal, especially on a road that \nBowser already knows about. \nLogic gets thrown out the window in this film to cram in as many references to the Mario \nfranchise as possible. Some of these references are fun background details (I loved the \npizza shop named “Punch-Out Pizza” and seeing some kind of Duck Hunt tavern), but others \nfeel like inclusions simply for the sake of pointing to the games. Mario actually eating \nmushrooms, for instance, is kind of off-putting, but then it doesn’t even really factor into the \nstory. He uses them in a couple of scenes and that’s it. The same goes for his cat-suit, which \nhe uses to pummel DK into submission but then completely forgets about after. \nWorse than that, Mario isn’t even the main character in his own film. This story is truly about \nPeach’s dedication to her kingdom and how far she’ll go to protect it. As a fan, I love that this \nstory doesn’t portray Peach as totally worthless, but so much of the movie is dedicated to \nher that it feels like Mario is mostly going along for the ride. Luigi, too, has a prominent role \nin the beginning segments before disappearing for nearly half of the film. The brothers aren’t \nall that important, I suppose. \nYou really can’t look at the film the way I am, however. I’m not suggesting viewers turn their \nbrains off and simply clap at the pretty lights. The animation is absolutely gorgeous, which is \na major feat for Illumination. The studio typically does the bare minimum when it comes to \ngussying up its films, but The Super Mario Bros. Movie looks better than practically every 3D \niteration of the series. No, when I say you can’t look at this movie with a fine tooth comb, I \nmean that this isn’t a movie meant for deeper analysis. \nThe best way I can put it is that The Super Mario Bros. Movie is the very definition of a \npopcorn flick. This is something you take the kids to, get a big tub of popcorn to share with \nyour significant other, and just smile at all the fun references and such. Once you leave the \ntheater, you put it out of your mind and go about your day. It’s harmless entertainment that \ncan be a little aggravating with how close it gets to being good, but that doesn’t deserve any \nderision and hatred. \nChildren will absolutely love what they see and they’ll likely be acting out some of the funnier \nscenes for months to come. I do think it’s a little bizarre how many references there are to\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 3**\n\"\"\"\nkilling in a PG-rated film (Bowser even says something about making Mario watch as he kills \nhis brother), but then you get things like the gleefully depressed Luma and Bowser singing a \nlove anthem to his Peachy. \nI could bring up how the soundtrack doesn’t really work, especially since Illumination just has \nto license out popular songs despite them having nothing to do with Super Mario. I’m not \nsure how A-Ha’s “Take on Me” or AC/DC’s “Thunderstruck” fit into this universe, especially \nwhen game composer Koji Kondo has a treasure trove of utterly classic songs that could fill \nout an entire saga of films, but that’s more a symptom of this being a big Hollywood film. \nEven with a property as rich as Super Mario, the grubby hands of corporate filmmaking \nsimply couldn’t shy away from such an opportunity. \nStill, as much as I may have left this film feeling indifferent, I spied a party happening in my \ntheater as I was leaving. It was filled with children who had just seen the movie, some from \nmy own theater, that were eating mushroom-shaped cakes, wearing Mario and Luigi caps, \nand jumping around for joy. To them, all of the plot inconsistencies and ham-fisted \nreferences didn’t matter. They got to see their favorite gaming icons on the big screen in a \nfilm that at least paid respect to the legacy of the brothers. \nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie is not going to go down as an all-time animated classic. It’s \nalso nowhere even close to being the best video game adaptation ever produced. While you \ncan poo-poo some of its story decisions and grumble about how the plot is about as deep as \na puddle, it still possesses enough of Mario’s charm to be worth a watch. When there is \nmuch worse drivel out there for children that doesn’t respect their intelligence or pay \nreverence to things they hold dear, something like The Super Mario Bros. Movie being just \nokay is perfectly fine.\n\"\"\"\n\n", "document_id": "doc_fd8cd535"}
