## Video Segment: 19:22 - 28:46

[SLIDE DESCRIPTION]
The slide is titled &quot;Data Mining&quot;. It asks &quot;What is data mining?&quot; and provides the answer: &quot;Seeking unexpected pearls of wisdom&quot;. It also lists the &quot;Origins of data mining&quot; with a diagram showing Data Mining at the center, connected to Statistics, Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning, AI, Database, and Data Warehousing.

[TRANSCRIPT - 19:22]
<span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">So what is data mining? And so, so the data mining actually one very important keyword is called unexpected. Which means that you did not know such thing happen before you analyze the data. If you already know what&#x27;s going on, you just retrieve it. It&#x27;s called information retrieval. So you would heard about different terminology. What is</span> called data mining? Data mining is you the mining actually is like like gold mining, you have a lot of data. And then somewhere some data actually if they be uncovered, then you can find something quite interesting. That is called data mining. And we try to look for those unexpected thing. So origin of the data mining actually come from many, many different place. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Statistics, pattern recognition, machine learning, AI, database, data warehousing.</span> You will find out each one of them can become one individual class, not just class, but one individual course. Like we have machine learning course, we have artificial intelligence course, we have database course, we have data mining course, data warehousing course, statistics, pattern recognition. But then you can even say that okay, so if that is the cases, why I need to study data mining? <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Because we reuse some technique being introduced from those field.</span> But then you can even say that okay, so if that is the cases, why I need to study data mining? Because we reuse some technique being introduced from those field.

[SLIDE DESCRIPTION]
The slide is titled &quot;Why Data Mining?&quot;. It lists two reasons: &quot;Traditional techniques may be unsuitable due to Enormity of data&quot; and &quot;High dimensionality of data&quot;. It also shows images related to Traffic Patterns and Cyber Security, and a graphic representing E-Commerce and IOT.

[TRANSCRIPT - 21:02]
Why Data Mining? <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Traditional techniques may be unsuitable due to Enormity of data. Huge data. For example, certain statistic methodology is good for not huge data. Maybe or not good for certain data.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">And then like cybersecurity. So, for example, if you went to high school barefoot right there, you&#x27;ll find out there have a lot of traffic data. And then like cybersecurity. In the end, those data will become very, enormously. And then like cybersecurity, it will every, every information we deliver through the internet will become a piece of information. And but how do you know which action are related to hacker? So you need to do certain mining about that. So cybersecurity actually is also because the data is quite large. You need to do something somehow dig out of them.</span> And sometimes it&#x27;s also because our data have called something we call high dimensionality. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Which means that X is one dimension, Y is one dimension. But in data mining, we usually have a lot of dimension, thousand or 10,000 or millions of dimension. Why? Because each feature we consider them as a dimension. Each feature as considered as a dimension.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">So, for example, if you went to e-commerce. This is my browsing history. Every browsing history, you will have a lot of feature. Which book you try to check? How many customer, how many books, how many video? Each one of them. Just imagine in those e-commerce store. The dimensionality is high enough, like millions or trillions of the thing right there.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Also, the data mining also try to take care of certain thing we call heterogeneous data.</span> What is called heterogeneous data? <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">So I hope everyone heard of certain thing called IOT, Internet of Things.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Internet of Things is like we have so many devices, all connected through internet. Each devices have their own record, okay? Each devices have their own record, have their own attribute, have different way. So then if you want to somehow try to integrate all the data through the different devices, the data resources also might have different type of them. So that is why we call them heterogeneous. Or maybe you heard about something called homogeneous, which means if they are the same, all of them are uniform. They are coming from the same type. Data mining, we try to emphasize on the data might be heterogeneous.</span>

[SLIDE DESCRIPTION]
The slide is titled &quot;Different Emphases of Courses&quot;. It lists &quot;Data Mining&quot; (Pattern discovery in large datasets) and &quot;Data Science&quot; (End-to-end data analysis: cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing; Machine learning for learning from data; Artificial Intelligence: Mimicking human intelligence in machines). It shows a Venn diagram illustrating the overlap between Data Mining and Data Science.

[TRANSCRIPT - 24:22]
Different Emphases of Courses. Okay. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Data mining. So then you actually consider how the data mining and data science. So then you can imagine this is how I consider how the data mining and data science. And but the in data mining, you can find out that there were also do the cleaning, analyzing and visualizing. But they try to do something a little bit more, try to apply them to certain application. That is usually how the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">data science. And in the data mining, we try to teach you to practice how to find the pattern through the large data.</span> But if you try to take the machine learning courses, actually <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">machine learning course, um, usually will cover a lot of algorithm. How you try to learn them? So you can imagine machine learning course, actually they give you a little bit narrow. So if you from that perspective, and then the core part is they try to reason with you, what kind of algorithm? Where the algorithm come from?</span></span> What is the theoretical point of it? Try to go through them. So they try to give you all the algorithm right here. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Mimicking human intelligence in machines. Called artificial intelligence.</span> So then you can imagine artificial intelligence is just like this. You will say, oh, not fair, how come they are so big? Because <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">in ancient time, artificial intelligence, when I say ancient time, like 50 years already ancient enough. Because in computer, like 50 years already ancient enough. When the term being introduced, they tried to know is any subject can mimic the human intelligence. And then they try to mimic them in the machine.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">So then if you actually heard about, for example, in certain time, they try to talking about logic deduction. And then talking about how the learning can be represented in the different way. And if certain subject they are mature enough, they will cut them out. Say, okay, so that belong to neural network. It is not AI anymore.</span> So AI remain something called. So that was ancient time. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Right now, in this time, so that&#x27;s why that ancient time. Right now, the AI will not directly say, let me cut out the machine learning, let me cut out the data mining, if because if you cut them out, then nothing left.</span> So then but they will also cover a lot of thing that are not that popular. So, you know, there is a different kind of the courses related to AI. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="17" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">And</span>, um, so if you&#x27;re interest in what else, what other possible AI technique can be, um, can be mentioned, then you can take the machine learning course. And if you want to know the fundamental theoretical thing, then you can take the machine learning course. Okay. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="18" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">And you want to really try to make the data, not only try to find the data and try to have the application and try to emphasize that how you can visualize them, and make the user to visualize them, data science usually try to cover a lot.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="19" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">In this particular course, we try to tell you how we try to find the pattern.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="20" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">So then the patterns sometimes is difficult for us to directly go through the lecture. So then the patterns, um, is difficult for us to directly go through the lecture.</span>
