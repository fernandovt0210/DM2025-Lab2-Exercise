Review: The Super Mario Bros. Movie 
By Peter Glagowski 

For some inane reason, <span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">film reviewers usually fail to understand the appeal of video games</span>. 
Whether it be the culture around how shoddy older adaptations were or because they 
believe film is a superior art form, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">we’re still seeing reviews from professional writers about 
how something like the Super Mario Bros. Movie is a failure of the art form</span>. 
As a lifelong Mario fan, I didn’t really know what to expect when I went to see the film. I had 
been excited since Nintendo was directly involved in this film, but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">we’ve also come a long 
way in the intervening 30 years from the original, disastrous Super Mario Bros. film</span>. Now 
there are quality video games out there such as Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and Detention. Can 
Nintendo’s plumber stack up? 
Well, the answer is yes and no. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">It really depends on whether or not you still have a childlike 
wonder about film, which can be understandably hard to muster much enthusiasm for 
nowadays when everything is part of some corporate machine</span>. 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The general plot of The Super Mario Bros. Movie was thankfully not spoiled by all of the 
marketing pre-release</span>. Instead of a story about Mario trying to save the princess like in the 
games, this time, we have a mixture of that original 90’s Mario film and the world of 
Nintendo’s classic franchise. Starting in Brooklyn, NYC, brothers Mario (Chris Pratt) and 
Luigi (Charlie Day) are plucky upstarts in the plumbing game after having just left their 
construction job from Spike (Sebastian Maniscalco) at Wrecking Crew. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Spike believes the 
duo will fail</span> and that is further beaten into their heads when <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">even their own father tells them 
they are doomed</span>. 
After a job goes sideways thanks to a vicious dog, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Mario is down in the dumps</span>. When Luigi 
attempts to cheer him up following a family dinner, Mario sees a report on the news about a 
flood down in the streets of Brooklyn. The two race off to save the city, but wind up getting 
sucked into a mysterious pipe that transports them to the Mushroom Kingdom, the home of 
Toads, Koopas, Goombas, and the royal Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy). 
At a brisk 92 minutes of runtime, The Super Mario Bros. Movie doesn’t ever slow down to 
develop things much. While I’m skipping over some details -including a prologue where 
Bowser (Jack Black) takes over a kingdom of penguins-, there is a sense that Nintendo and 
production company Illumination (known for The Minions) <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">aimed this film squarely at 
children</span>. I don’t say that as a negative, but more that viewing this as an adult, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">I find myself 
nitpicking some loose ends because the film has no answers for them</span>. 
There is clearly a story angle of Mario wanting to prove himself to his family and brother, but 
then that gets sidelined for Peach’s struggle against Bowser. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Luigi gets small bits of 
backstory about how his brother always protected him, but that thread goes nowhere</span>. Before 
you think this is just setting up some payoff for the conclusion of the film, another wrinkle 
gets added when Peach decides to visit the Kong Kingdom and recruit the forces of Cranky
&quot;&quot;&quot;

**Page 2**
&quot;&quot;&quot;
Kong (Fred Armisen) and his son Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen). <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">There is simply too much 
going on for anything to really stand out</span>. 
That is except for <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Jack Black’s portrayal of the King of the Koopas. Bowser is very clearly a 
highlight here, from his performance to his visual design and his lopsided view of romance</span>. 
Taking an angle from Super Mario Sunshine, Bowser simply wants a wife to rule the world 
with him. While he has a distorted view of how to get that, causing him to become a villain, 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">it’s hard not to feel sorry for the big guy</span>. He really just wants to make life better for his 
underlings. 
But a lot of that is inferred story. I wouldn’t call it subtext, per se, but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">what The Super Mario 
Bros. Movie truly feels like is an overload of fanservice</span>. I’m not going to reiterate talking 
points from other reviews where they can’t understand why go-karts are driving on a literal 
rainbow because that is irrelevant. It’s just a cool visual that was created in Mario Kart to 
differentiate the track design. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">What does become puzzling is why the Kong Kingdom thought 
driving karts was faster than using their barrel jets for traversal, especially on a road that 
Bowser already knows about.</span> 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Logic gets thrown out the window in this film to cram in as many references to the Mario 
franchise as possible.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="17" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Some of these references are fun background details</span> (I loved the 
pizza shop named “Punch-Out Pizza” and seeing some kind of Duck Hunt tavern), but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="18" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">others 
feel like inclusions simply for the sake of pointing to the games.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="19" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Mario actually eating 
mushrooms, for instance, is kind of off-putting</span>, but then it doesn’t even really factor into the 
story. He uses them in a couple of scenes and that’s it. The same goes for his cat-suit, which 
he uses to pummel DK into submission but then completely forgets about after. 
Worse than that, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="20" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Mario isn’t even the main character in his own film.</span> This story is truly about 
Peach’s dedication to her kingdom and how far she’ll go to protect it. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="21" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">As a fan, I love that this 
story doesn’t portray Peach as totally worthless</span>, but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="22" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">so much of the movie is dedicated to 
her that it feels like Mario is mostly going along for the ride.</span> Luigi, too, has a prominent role 
in the beginning segments before disappearing for nearly half of the film. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="23" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The brothers aren’t 
all that important, I suppose.</span> 
You really can’t look at the film the way I am, however. I’m not suggesting viewers turn their 
brains off and simply clap at the pretty lights. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="24" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The animation is absolutely gorgeous</span>, which is 
a major feat for Illumination. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="25" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The studio typically does the bare minimum when it comes to 
gussying up its films</span>, but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="26" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The Super Mario Bros. Movie looks better than practically every 3D 
iteration of the series.</span> No, when I say you can’t look at this movie with a fine tooth comb, I 
mean that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="27" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">this isn’t a movie meant for deeper analysis</span>. 
The best way I can put it is that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="28" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The Super Mario Bros. Movie is the very definition of a 
popcorn flick</span>. This is something <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="29" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">you take the kids to, get a big tub of popcorn to share with 
your significant other, and just smile at all the fun references and such</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="30" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Once you leave the 
theater, you put it out of your mind and go about your day</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="31" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">It’s harmless entertainment that 
can be a little aggravating with how close it gets to being good, but that doesn’t deserve any 
derision and hatred</span>. 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="32" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Children will absolutely love what they see</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="33" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">they’ll likely be acting out some of the funnier 
scenes for months to come</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="34" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">I do think it’s a little bizarre how many references there are to</span>
&quot;&quot;&quot;

&quot;&quot;&quot;
killing in a PG-rated film (Bowser even says something about making Mario watch as he kills 
his brother), but then you get things like the gleefully depressed Luma and Bowser singing a 
love anthem to his Peachy. 
I could bring up how <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="35" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the soundtrack doesn’t really work</span>, especially since <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="36" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Illumination just has 
to license out popular songs despite them having nothing to do with Super Mario</span>. I’m not 
sure how A-Ha’s “Take on Me” or AC/DC’s “Thunderstruck” fit into this universe, especially 
when game composer Koji Kondo has a treasure trove of utterly classic songs that could fill 
out an entire saga of films, but that’s more a symptom of this being a big Hollywood film. 
Even with a property as rich as Super Mario, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="37" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the grubby hands of corporate filmmaking 
simply couldn’t shy away from such an opportunity</span>. 
Still, as much as <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="38" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">I may have left this film feeling indifferent</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="39" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">I spied a party happening in my 
theater as I was leaving. It was filled with children who had just seen the movie, some from 
my own theater, that were eating mushroom-shaped cakes, wearing Mario and Luigi caps, 
and jumping around for joy</span>. To them, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="40" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">all of the plot inconsistencies and ham-fisted 
references didn’t matter</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="41" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">They got to see their favorite gaming icons on the big screen in a 
film that at least paid respect to the legacy of the brothers</span>. 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="42" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The Super Mario Bros. Movie is not going to go down as an all-time animated classic</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="43" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">It’s 
also nowhere even close to being the best video game adaptation ever produced</span>. While <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="44" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">you 
can poo-poo some of its story decisions and grumble about how the plot is about as deep as 
a puddle</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="45" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">it still possesses enough of Mario’s charm to be worth a watch</span>. When there is 
much worse drivel out there for children that doesn’t respect their intelligence or pay 
reverence to things they hold dear, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="46" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">something like The Super Mario Bros. Movie being just 
okay is perfectly fine</span>.
